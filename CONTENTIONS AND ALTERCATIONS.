Now since life is an amazing experiece it can take someone from place to place regardless of skin color;race; class or even tribal orientation.
No one got powers to decide intentional life decisions;no;it will make realities materialise on its own instead;likng it or not!!
Be it a financial decision or a simple domestic matter involving romantic affairs and kids inside;or a mere mindless street life in absence of
reasonable conscience;no one can stop it in time life decided is proper.
Well;let me leave it for time being and await next time for an extended altercation and contention!!
