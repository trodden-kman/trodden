<p style="font-size: 2vw;font-family: sans-serif;padding: 15px;border: 1px;background-color:">Life is an amazing  phenomenon and reality;and its goodness and pleasure lies in its capacity to take people from one place to another the world over no matter what <b>racial identity,social class;religious orientation;or even cultural and economic status
</b>
<br>
Some of us the ordinary people would be flown around local scenes by the very same life;getting in touch and chilling out with our local buddies ;while some of our buddies are blessed with the privilege and right to be flown into farther most places of the universe by this same good life;getting to experiment with new and strange faces together with breath taking visuals and seductive sights
<br>
Such are the offerings this amazing good life can provide for;offerings that are not without limits and restrictions.
<br>
Limits that knows no color nor race;for when the impossibilities has been turned to possibilities and possibilities to impossibilities by this same good life nothing can come and stand before that offer;same applies to such restrictive compulsions of this good life;for when one is naturally bound to fulfill their compulsory responsibilities justification of their deeds shall not be provided until they have done what is right;
<br>
whether be it the<b> showing of true love to their close associates;taking good care of their biological children;showing respect to parents and the elderly;living in harmony no matter what racial identity;or better still;just reasonably greeting people you come into contact with,</b>
<br>
either practically or not;all these in the interest of <b><u>good living and good humanity.</u></b></p>  
<p style="font-size: 5vw;font-family: sans-serif;text-align: center;"><b><u>HELLO UNIVERSE!!</u></b>
