<p style="font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 2vw;text-align: left;">And as the sole facilitator and proponent of this project;
<br>
I therefore feel bound  to actually explain what it is all about.
<br>
But before even going too far;let me feel free to say that I have been struggling <b><u>heavily</u></b> for some time in this good life;
<br>
trying to find a mean through which to get things going;and so because of that eager to do that I just could not stop conducting researches and consulting with relevant sources so as to find a way through;
<br>
and eventually when that opportunity showed up;I just decided taking a dive;thanks to those existing sources of information and good advice!!
<br>
<hr>
<p style="font-size: 2vw;font-family: sans-serif;text-align: left;">And here I am today;with all that had been wished for being with me though not completely;but as the saying goes on that a little is better than nothing at all so say me;
<br>
and that to everything give thanks;so still say me to myself.
<hr>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 2vw;text-align: left;">This is a project whose sole mission is to tackle deeper issues affecting all of us as natural living beings in our supposed comfortable societal settlements;
</p>
<p style="font-size: 2vw;font-family: sans-serif;text-align: center;">
issues of love and hate;</p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 2vw;text-align: center;">
issues of respect and disrepect;</p>
<p style="font-size: 2vw;font-family: sans-serif;text-align: center;">
issues of class and color;</p>
<po style="font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 2vw;text-align: center">
issues of culture and religion;</p>
<p style="font-size: 2vw;font-family: sans-serif;text-align: center;">
and issues of the physic and spirit.</p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 2vw;text-align: center;">
And hopefully;all these are issues upon which the rest of humanity is based and around which the<b><u> people and societies</u></b> revolves.
<br>
Issues of the people and society.
<hr> 
<p style="text-align: center;font-family:  sans-serif;font-size: 2vw;"><u><b>And as long as the outlook is promising;on my part; this project will continue or collapse under unwelcome circumstances.</b></u></p>
